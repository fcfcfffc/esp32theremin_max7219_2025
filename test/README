This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

ESP32 Frequency-to-PWM with ESP-NOW Transmission
This project implements a frequency detection and PWM generation system using an ESP32. It reads an input signal's frequency using the ESP32's Pulse Counter (PCNT) hardware, compares it with a base reference frequency, maps the frequency difference to a PWM duty cycle, and transmits the result wirelessly via ESP-NOW to a peer ESP32 device.

🧠 Key Features
Frequency Measurement: Uses hardware PCNT on pin GPIO 1 to measure input frequency (e.g., from a beat signal or oscillator).

PWM Output: Maps frequency difference to an 8-bit PWM signal on GPIO 2.

Wireless Communication: Transmits PWM values via ESP-NOW to another ESP32 (define peer MAC).

Base Frequency Calibration:

Manual: Press a button (GPIO 19) to set the base reference frequency.

Auto: When the signal is stable, the base frequency updates automatically.

Stability Detection: Uses smoothed frequency changes to determine signal stability.

📦 Hardware Requirements
ESP32 (e.g., ESP32-S3)

Signal input (e.g., sensor output or waveform generator)

Push button (connected to GPIO 19)

PWM-controllable device (e.g., LED or servo)

Another ESP32 as receiver (for ESP-NOW)
